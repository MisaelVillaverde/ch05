## Reach
Market penetration of your product: the number of people viewing your website or using your service. There's a direct correlation between reach and profitability.

## Functionality
The quality of your site's functionality will have a large impact on user retention. Functionality offers the most opportunity for test automation.

## Usability
Evaluates Human-computer interaction(HCI).
User testing should be included in your QA plan.

## Aesthetics
Aesthetics is the most subjective of the four dimensions and is therefore the least relevant to development.
Show your site to a representative sample audience, and find out if it feels dated or does not invoke the desired response.
